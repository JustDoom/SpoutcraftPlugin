# SpoutcraftPlugin

SpoutcraftPlugin is a plugin for [Bukkit](http://www.bukkit.org), which extends the Bukkit API to provide features that aren't normally available.

Spoutcraft was abandoned years ago so the ReSpouted team is aiming to get it back to a usable state for preservation purposes! Check out the original README me [here](./OLD_README.md)

## Getting started

The client is being worked on but the plugin is possible to compile if you have a CraftBukkit 1.6.4 file. Already compiled versions will be released at some point.

## Contributing

Coming Soon
